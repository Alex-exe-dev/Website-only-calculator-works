This will hopefully sometimes be a website where you can manage your income and expenditure!


The index.js script creates a server on your loacalhost for you (Port:80). It was created by @0bMERLIN (https://github.com/0bMERLIN).

If you try to run this code yourself you might notice that some files in /media and /styles are missing. This is due to copyright reasons.
You should find all filenames somewhere in the css / html files. After that you can simply google the fonts to compleate your build.
